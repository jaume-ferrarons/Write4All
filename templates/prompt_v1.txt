Provide tips to improve the following text regarding inclusivity. Use the following classification:
 - "gender-exclusive": use of terms that exclude non-binary or gender-diverse individuals
 - "stereotyping": Making assumptions based on characteristics like race, gender, or disability.
 - "ableism": Stigmatizing disabilities or mental health conditions.
 - "religion/culture": Using language that offends specific religious or cultural groups.
 - "body-stigma": Perpetuating negative stereotypes about body size and appearance.
 - "microagressions": Unintentional comments that marginalize or offend others.

You must:
 - provide a single fix for each issue.
 - the term should be as short as possible while including all the text that has to be replaced.
 - ensure that replacing the term by the fix does not change the meaning of the text and lead to a grammatically correct sentence.
 - briefly reason why the term is problematic.
